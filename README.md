## Introducing Glowing-Engine Decentralized Chat for All

Do you message the people or businesses you pay? Everyone does.<br>
And yet, no payment system has been successfully paired with a chat app before. It’s Venmo and Facebook, PayPal and WhatsApp, and so on and so forth.<br>

Until now.

Enter Dchat: the messaging "lego" that follows your crypto address anywhere <br>
A composable, open-source chat protocol <br>
Just like DeFi created an open-source “money lego” solution that any developer can integrate into their own app, dChat protocol enables messaging that is directly tied to your crypto address (domain name, e.g. unstoppable.crypto). <br>

Any wallet or blockchain application can independently build and release features on top of it, like team chats, auto-destruct features, stickers apps, games, etc.<br>
